# Install the wordpress plugin

This section is dedicated to installing the Nopow-Link plugin for your Wordpress website. This plugin allows your website to interact with Nopow-Link and provide the links exchanged on our marketplace.

### Start install

After entering the URL of your website in the configuration settings of your account, you must select the plugin associated with the technology used by your website. If you don't know what technology your website uses, you can use [wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com/) to find out.

Note that Nopow-Link may not be natively compatible with your website's technology. In this case you can use the portable version of our plugin. More information [here](../portable_version.md).

Once selected, all you have to do is click on the download button to get the plugin. You should then have a `zip` type archive file. Note that above the download button is your API key, which will be required when installing the plugin on your website.

### Certify plugin

You are almost there. In order to guarantee that you are the owner of your site, we need to carry out a first exchange of information with this one. To do this, go to the "Nopow-Link" tab of your Wordpress administrator interface.

> Note that if you do not see the Nopow-Link tab after installing the plugin, it is certainly because the plugin is not activated. Go to the "plugins" tab then click on the under "installed plugin", you will find the list of all the plugins installed on your Wordpress site. Find the Nopow-Link plugin in the list then click on the small activate button.

All you have to do is copy paste the activation key that was provided to you in your Nopow-Link user space and click on the "certify plugin" button.
